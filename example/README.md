# Example

Examples of how to use Plotly with Flutter web.  
Run the ```main.dart``` file. 

## Example 1 'Line and Scatter'
Shows example how to capture the 'plotly_hover' events.  If the 
mouse is over a data point, you can display a *message* associated 
with that point.  The *message* disappears once the mouse is no 
longer over the point.


## Example 2 'TimeSeries Plot'
Shows an example of how to add and remove series from a plot.  Also, it 
shows how to highlight some area on the plot by capturing the 'plotly_relayout' 
events. 

The example also shows plotly performance in drawing 2 timeseries with 8760 
elements each.  No annoying lag is noticeable when additional timeseries 
are added to the plot.
